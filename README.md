React assignment. Bootstrapped with create-react-app.

### User Stories
- [] You need to have a running web application that will show the above display if i run `npm run start` from inside the project folder.
- [x] All code should be written using es6 syntaxes.
- [] The finished source code should be posted in github which can be cloned and verified by running the software using the standard node based tools.
- [] The UI must have at least four components...
  - [x] The parent application component that organizes all child components.
  - [x] The header component that display the header text Manage my items.
  - [] The input component with the input box with an Add item button on its right.
  - [] At the bottom an unordered list of items with the header giving a count of items in the list. Each item in the list can be kept inline or could be separated into its own component. The second one highly recommended.
- [] Class based component must follow example template
- [] The finished code expected to be mix of class based and functional components.
- [] All components should be in its separate files, inlining in a single file is not allowed
- [] Styling must be done only using styled-components module. All style components could be consolidated in a single file or could be distributed in multiple files. However, it must not be mixed with the regular component files.
- [] Layout of the display must be done with flexbox. You could use grid-styled module for that. You could also use rebass for reusable react components.
- [] Prettier must be used to format all code.
- [] Use redux for state management.
- [] Add unit tests for your components, at least for the header component.
